# barely update these btw!
## my skins are mostly just an edit from other player skins and are not original

### [- **-     『CodeName∶ Bloo』 - + 4k mania yoth99 edit v.2**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DWOTqDrxyysv5loP2Bi6ew6B9ax0l2Ms/view?usp=drive_link)
###### this skin is slightly edited from what I use because the original uses some private skin assets which the creator/owner doesn't want to publish

*this skin in specific has 5 different LN tails to choose from (all percy LNs)
  * noteLS  
    shortest of them all
  * noteL  
    shorter, I usualy use this
  * noteLL  
    a bit longer
  * noteLo  
    longest, the original LN that came with the skin (took it form crewK's skin I think, can't remember)
    
  * noteLC  
    taken from LostCool's 7k skin that has percy, only in the skin bcuz i tried using it
